This code was designed and built for the TMS320F28379D Launchpad board to automatically control an electronic clutch (or actuator that controls a clutch).
In it's current state it is set up to manage a singular clutch system.
The program outputs two PWM signals for two seperate clutches, but both are adjusted the same based on inputs. They do not respond to changes individually.
Additional information can be found in the Final Project Report.
